# Market Basket Analysis (Predictive)
## Project Overview

It's a data mining technique to better understand the buyers' buying behaviour/habit to identify the product groups or items that are frequently brought together. After analysing the data we'll be able to recommend items or products that they are most likely to buy along with them. It's helpful for the retailers or for the business to increase their sales, therefore revenue by the means of cross selling.

  2. masterdata (Product_ID, Price and Product_name) --> Product details
  3. newbasket (Items and BasketNo)
